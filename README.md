The Murinae (the Old World mice and rats) include the most commonly used laboratory speciesâ€”the mouse Mus musculus and the rat Rattus norvegicus. 

I will be using the sequenced gene data from regions GHR	RAG1 AP5 and mitochondrial DNA from the species specified in Appendix B of the paper. The data can be found using BLAST in GenBank(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/about/) by entering their accession numbers.
