# Botany 563 Project Spring 2025

My final project will be using and analyzing the sequencing data 
from three unlinked nuclear genes and one mitochondrial region of selected spieces of Murinae family described in the paper.

# QC of sequenced genome data with Bootstrap and Bayesian Analysis for Robustness
1. Nonparametric bootstrapping (Felsenstein, 1985) was performed on all data partitions: 200 replicates for ML and 500 replicates for MP.
2. Bootstrap analyses for MP and ML used 10 random-sequence addition replicates per bootstrap replicate.
3. Likelihood bootstrap analyses were limited to 2â€“4000 rearrangements for individual nuclear genes (10,000 for AP5) and combined-data set.
4. 20 random-sequence addition replicates and 40,000 rearrangements (per each sequence-addition replicate) for the mitochondrial data set.
